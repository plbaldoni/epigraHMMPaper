This is the readme file for the endfloat package v2.7

This readme was modified on October 2, 1997 but without
updated endfloat itself, instead to fix errors in this file
and in endfloat.ins

It was again modified on March 31, 2006, by Frank K\"uster
<frank@kuesterei.ch> to indicate the license clarification (see below).

It was again modified on December 4, 2011, by Axel Sommerfeldt
<axel.sommerfeldt@f-m.fm> to reflect the changes introduced
with version 2.5 of the endfloat package.

It was again modified on March 24, 2018, by Axel Sommerfeldt
<axel.sommerfeldt@f-m.fm> to reflect the changes introduced
with version 2.6 of the endfloat package.

It was again modified on April 15, 2019, by Axel Sommerfeldt

with version 2.7 of the endfloat package.

Endfloat is a LaTeX package.  Versions 2.1 and above require
LaTeX2e.

Accompanying files should be:

	README				This file
	endfloat.dtx			Docstrip archive  (essential)
	endfloat.ins			(La)TeX batch file (if you
					    don't know what it is
					    then you DO need it)

===============================================================================
Overview:
  the package places figures and tables at the end of the document,
  as often requested by journals for non-camera ready submission.

===============================================================================
Installation:

Run

  latex endfloat.ins

This will produce three files, endfloat.sty, endfloat.drv and efxmpl.cfg .
You can run LaTeX on endfloat.drv for the documentation.
  
You should copy the file endfloat.sty to where you keep
your (La)TeX inputs.  You should read the documentation to find out
more about the example configuration file, efxmpl.cfg.

To produce the documentation, run LaTeX on endfloat.drv (or endfloat.dtx)
a couple of times, and then use the makeindex program (which might be
called makeindx on your system) to generate the index

 makeindex -g -s gind.ist endfloat

Then run LaTeX (at least) two more times to get the index in the table
of contents.
